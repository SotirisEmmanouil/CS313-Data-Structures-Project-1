# CS313-Data-Structures-Project-1

## Reversed Linked List Project

This repository contains all the files that are needed to create, fill, and reverse the nodes of a LinkedList. This project was created while taking Dr.Rozovskaya's CS313 Data Structures course at CUNY Queens College. This project utilizes a dynamically allocated array and the `append(int s)` method to create the nodes of the LinkedList using the entries of the dynamically allocated array. The dynamically allocated array is critical as it sets the amount of nodes in the LinkedList to be filled. The `reverse()` method reverses the nodes. This project helped me learn more about data structures, specifically LinkedLists and dynamic programming.
