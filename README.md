## Reversed Linked List Project

This repository contains all the files that are needed to create, fill, and reverse the nodes of a LinkedList. This project was created while taking Dr.Alla Rozovskaya's CS313 Data Structures course at CUNY Queens College. This project utilizes the `append(int s)` method to create the nodes of the LinkedList using the entries entered by the user. The `reverse()` method reverses the nodes. This project helped me learn more about data structures, specifically LinkedLists.
